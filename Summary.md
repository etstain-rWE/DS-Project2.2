Summary of the Movie Analysis Study
This study aimed to explore various aspects of movies, including their popularity, ratings, vote counts, and distribution across genres. Below are the key questions explored in this study and the corresponding insights:

1. Latest Movies in Theaters
Objective: To identify movies that have been released in the most recent year and month.
Process: By filtering movies based on their release dates, we were able to list the movies that had been released in the latest year and month. This helped us focus on newly released content.
2. Distribution of Movies Across Various Genres
Objective: To explore the distribution of movies across different genres and understand their popularity.
Process: The genre data was analyzed to determine how movies are distributed among various genres (e.g., action, drama, comedy, etc.). This helped uncover trends in the most common and popular genres.
3. Discover Which Movies Are the Most Popular and Talked About
Objective: To identify the movies with the highest popularity scores and the most votes, signifying those that have garnered the most attention.
Process: Popularity was assessed based on the number of votes and the average rating. Movies with higher popularity scores and significant vote counts were categorized as the most talked about.
4. Most Popular Movies Released in Which Year?
Objective: To determine the year in which the most popular movies were released.
Process: By analyzing the popularity and vote counts for movies across different years, we identified which years saw the release of the most popular movies. This provided insight into which years had significant movie releases.
5. Difference Between Ratings (vote_average) and Number of Votes (vote_count)
Objective: To investigate whether there is a significant difference between the movie's average rating and its vote count.
Process: We examined the relationship between ratings and vote counts, identifying movies that had high ratings but relatively low vote counts. This helped uncover potential biases or anomalies in voting behavior and movie reception.
6. Best Movies Based on Ratings, Popularity, and Number of Votes
Objective: To identify movies that could be considered the “best” based on their combination of ratings, popularity, and vote counts.
Process: By weighting the importance of rating, popularity, and vote count, we created a combined score to identify the top movies. These movies were considered the “best” as they performed well across all three aspects.
7. Movies with High Ratings but Low Vote Counts
Objective: To identify movies that have received high ratings but relatively few votes.
Process: We filtered movies based on a high average rating (above 8.0) but with fewer votes, highlighting films that may have flown under the radar or received niche audiences.
8. Movies with High Ratings but Average Ratings
Objective: To identify movies that are rated highly, but not exceptionally so (e.g., ratings between 6.0 and 7.5).
Process: We focused on movies with ratings in the range of 6.0 to 7.5, considering them to have “high but average” ratings. This analysis helped uncover movies that were still well-received but not at the top end of the rating scale.
